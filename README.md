# GREVIO - A Public Procurement System Transformation Strategy in the Midwest of Ireland
**Enabling Fair and Sustainable Public Food Procurement**  
_A DFL25 Project_

![GREVIO Poster](./Grevio Poster.jpg)

## Project Overview

**GREVIO** is a digital intervention strategy that transforms how public institutions approach food procurement. By embedding **equity**, **transparency**, and **sustainability** directly into procurement decisions, GREVIO ensures that public contracts serve people and the planetâ€”not just the lowest bidder.

## Why GREVIO Matters?

Public procurement is at a crossroads. Irelandâ€™s public food procurement system systematically excludes small, sustainable farmers due to outdated, complex policies favoring industrial suppliers. This undermines national food security, environmental goals, and local economic resilience. Without urgent reform, billions in public funds will continue reinforcing extractive food systems instead of empowering community-rooted, climate-aligned agriculture. GREVIO offers a **bridge** to a more just, transparent, and sustainable futureâ€”where **small farmers, ethical producers, and public values win**.

This 4-week project was part of the **DFL25 Challenge** and included deep research, systems thinking, speculative futures, and strategic prototyping.

All mappings, frameworks, sketches, and system design tools were created collaboratively on Miro.

## Journey Across 4 Weeks and

### Week 1: Grounding in Reality
- Conducted in-depth research on the current procurement ecosystem.
- Identified pain points faced by farmers, procurement officers, and institutions.

### Week 2: Exploring Future Possibilities
- Mapped critical uncertainties and created polarities.
- Built strong narrative foundations that guided our intervention.

### Week 3: Crafting the Solution
- Introduced **GREVIO** as a system-level intervention.
- Aligned the design with current market realities and the trajectory of policy and tech.

### Week 4: Final Design & Stakeholder Engagement
- Created the final **GREVIO Poster** presenting the flow, logic, and benefits of the solution.
- Presented GREVIO to various stakeholders, receiving validation, appreciation, and strong interest for real-world implementation.

## Tools & Methodologies used Across each week

The GREVIO project applied a structured, systems-thinking and speculative design approach. Each week combined tools, mapping methods, and structured WIP deliverables to build toward a comprehensive solution.

### Week 1 â€“ Mapping the Present  
**Focus:** Understanding the current ecosystem of public food procurement.

#### Tools Used
- **Concept & Connection Mapping**  
  Brain dump to map current knowledge, relationships, and ideas around procurement.
- **Actorâ€“Concernâ€“Device Map**  
  Mapped relationships between stakeholders, technologies, and institutional concerns.
- **Rulesâ€“Routinesâ€“Tools Diagram**  
  Categorized system forces shaping procurement behavior.
- **Socio-Technical System Mapping**  
  Visualized key flows, tensions, and interactions across actors and devices.

#### WIP Output: *Concern Mapping Portfolio*

### Week 2 â€“ Framing Future Possibilities  
**Focus:** Envisioning speculative and desirable futures.

#### Tools Used
- **Critical Uncertainties Mapping**  
  Defined two major tensions (e.g., centralized vs. decentralized procurement).
- **Scenario Matrix**  
  Created four future scenarios based on combinations of critical uncertainties.
- **Futures Cone**  
  Plotted probable, plausible, and preferred futures.
- **Scenario Sketching**  
  Developed visual and narrative descriptions of future procurement systems.

#### WIP Output: *From Uncertainties to Preferred Futures*

### Week 3 â€“ Prototyping the Intervention  
**Focus:** Designing GREVIO as a strategic system intervention.

#### Tools Used
- **Preferred System Elements Table**  
  Defined roles, exchanges, and motivations of future actors.
- **Preferred System DNA**  
  Captured the core values and systemic logic of the future system.
- **Devices from the Future**  
  Envisioned GREVIOâ€™s interface and functionality as a real-world tool.
- **Ecosystem Rewiring Map**  
  Showed how GREVIO shifts actor relationships and decision-making flows.

#### WIP Output: *Shaping the Market Device*

### Week 4 â€“ Translation & Real-World Framing  
**Focus:** Embedding GREVIO into real systems and preparing for stakeholder engagement.

- **GREVIO Poster:**  
  Visual summary of the problem, system design, and stakeholder impacts.
- **Stakeholder Presentation:**  
  Final pitch presented to internal/external evaluators with live feedback.

### Additional Tools & Practices Used Throughout
- **Kanban Board (MS Teams):**  
  Used to track weekly deliverables, tasks, and team coordination.
- **Internal Weekly Video Logs:**  
  Documented weekly progress, decision-making, and retrospectives.
- **Miro Boards:**  
  Central collaborative workspace for all mapping, sketching, and visual thinking.

> This layered use of strategic foresight, participatory design, and systems mapping allowed GREVIO to emerge as a **resilient, inclusive, and future-proof solution.**

## My Role: Project Lead

I served as the **Project Lead**, coordinating a diverse team. My core responsibilities:

- Contributed to **80%** of the research, system design, visual development, and narrative creation.
- Maintained a detailed **Kanban board** to track tasks, feedback, and iterations.
- Led weekly syncs via **MS Teams**, managing communication, stakeholder feedback, and team cohesion.

> These artifacts demonstrate the rigor, foresight, and systems thinking embedded throughout the GREVIO project.
